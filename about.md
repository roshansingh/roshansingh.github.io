Hi there!

My name is Roshan Singh. I have been a software developer for the last 10 years. I have worked at Zynga, Sysomos and Meltwater. I have been a full stack developer for the most part but enjoy backend and infrastructure more than frontend.

This blog was started in 2008 while I was still in college to save hacks for running things on Linux. I still use this as a notebook for things that I learn and share it with my friends.

Thanks for reading!
