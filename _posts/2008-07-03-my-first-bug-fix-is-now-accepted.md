It gives me immense pleasure to declare that my first bug fix is now accepted and available in the svn.It was committed to the trunk long back and I was waiting for it to become publicly available. Now it is available ðŸ™‚

You can see my name in the [Changelog](http://svn.gnome.org/svn/evolution/trunk/ui/ChangeLog).

i have fixed one more and am waiting for its approval. Hope it turns out positively.
