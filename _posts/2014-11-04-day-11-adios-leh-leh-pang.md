I spent next day walking around in Leh and tried Thukpa(Tibetan cuisine). Food is usually good in Leh but prices are generally high. Meanwhile I managed to find an optician and got new spectacles made.

It was time to head back. We could not go to lot of the places on our itinerary like Nubra Valley, Pangong Tso, Tso Moriri, still this was one trip that I will remember for my entire life. It&#8217;s because of the company! The college buddies were back, possibly for our last trip together.

Since we could not visit most of the places we decided to ride slow and enjoy the scenery.

Mesmerizing, isn&#8217;t it? Can&#8217;t remember where I clicked this. Set this as your wallpaper right now ðŸ™‚

Always far from home! This was a small watch tower on top of Gata Loops. That line had me thinking for a while to quit everything and run away!

During my last long ride, I had seen a river flowing between two mountains (near jog falls) covered with trees. Here the mountains were naked. Stopped here just to compare them.

Enough of the view! I need to go down and feel the cold water now.

Reached Pang, around 3 pm. Decided to halt here, got the same tent.
