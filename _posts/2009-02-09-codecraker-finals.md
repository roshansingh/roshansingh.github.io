I am writing this post from IT Dept lab from where the codecracker server is running. After a lot of problems and testing we finally managed to get codecracker working in Python and it has run smoothly without any failure till now. Now only 20 minutes are left for it to end. It feels good to be a part of an event as big as codecracker.
  
Rajat had set questions which were really tough than the last year. Mostly people from IIITs did the solutions. The stats will be given tomorrow morning. We had a team &#8216;ACRush&#8217; from china. Unfortunately he did not participate. Till now we have more than 300 submissions. The stats will be out by tomorrow morning.
  
But the performance of students from my college was really poor.
  
The source code of codecracker will be out very soon.
