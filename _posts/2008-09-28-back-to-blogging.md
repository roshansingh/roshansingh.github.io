Was very busy these days. To begin with Microsoft visited our college for interns for the first time and I could not even clear the written. I was really shocked with my performance. This really showed me how important coding was which I had lest for quite some time! I have realized this and have started coding at an online judge SPOJ. And after solving some problems I am a little relieved. I have started to code in C++ now which i had left after entering in this college. I will have to read STL also.

I am also participating in TGMC. This is really tough for beginners like me who a new to J2EE, XML, UML and other similar stuffs. But as I am reading more and more I am able to understand things. But the saddest part is that I am left with very little time only 15 days. I am not sure if I will be able to complete it. But Web Designing is really very interesting thing. I will surely put my all efforts to complete it.
