I think of holding a small hack week kind of thing at my college on GNU/Linux and FOSS where people arent serious about FOSS. This can help us create the hacking culture in our college.

I have thought of opendchub the hub software for Direct Connect client which we use for file sharing in our college because the source code is very small and it has a lot of scope for development and also it is usable.

If you have any opinion about any such sofware which does not have very big source code please share with me.
