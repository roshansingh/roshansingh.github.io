As we all know that GNU is itself a recursive acronym which stands for &#8220;GNU Not UNIX&#8221;. While studying how translations are done and managed in opensource softwares i found out two amazing naming patterns **&#8220;I18n & L10n** &#8220;.

Can you understand anything ?

No, I also could not get anything. **I18n** stands for **internationalization** and **L10n** stands for **localization** .

**AMAZED AREN&#8217;T YOU !!!**

Many people, tired of writing these long words over and over again, took the habit of writing **i18n** and _**l10n**_ instead, quoting the first and last letter of each word, and replacing the run of intermediate letters by a number merely telling how many such letters there are.
