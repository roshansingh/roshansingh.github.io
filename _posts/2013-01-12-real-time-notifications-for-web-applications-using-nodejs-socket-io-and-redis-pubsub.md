Recently I was working on a real time workflow for a module. I found it really difficult to find good tutorial for the same. I struggled with Flask, gevents and lot of other things and finally settled down to nodejs and socket.io and redis pubsub.

I have written a tutorial for the same <https://github.com/roshansingh/realtime-notifications>.

The beauty of nodejs is that everything was accomplished in less than 50 lines of code :). Read it and let me know if you have any feedback.
