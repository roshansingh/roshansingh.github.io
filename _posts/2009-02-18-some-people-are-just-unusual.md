I happen to know one such man he was my mentor, Johnny Jacob (just google him) when I was trying to hack Evolution in summer vacation last year. Nearly one and a half month back he contacted me to work on Evolution again. I was very much excited to do that but I was busy with dhvani those days. I thought that I would do that later on. But then I realized its time for me to think about a job. Yes I definitely need a job. It was then I realized that I cant afford higher studies at least now. So I have dumped the idea of working on any project for a few days until I get a job.
  
That man suddenly commented on my previous post I never knew he was following me. But it really feels good when some one remembers you. ðŸ™‚

Oh the installation on the server is finished need to configure everything. Will finish this post later.
