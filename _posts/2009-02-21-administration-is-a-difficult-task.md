Just a week back I start to manage our [GLUG server](http://lug.nitdgp.ac.in) and since then it has turned out to be a nightmare for me. Every now and then something happens and people start pinging you. Whenever I go out and come to room I just type the url of the server on my browser to see if it is working. It adds a lot to your responsibilities.

I tried several distros and finally ended up with my favourite openSUSE, I find myself very much comfortable with it. 

Some works to be done:
  
1. Fedora 10 repo
  
2. Ubuntu repo
  
3. Packman repo (we already have but it needs management)
  
4. More isos for download and for repo for network install
