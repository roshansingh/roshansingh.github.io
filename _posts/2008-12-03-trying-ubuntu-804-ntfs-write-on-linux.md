I have shifted to Ubuntu after using openSUSE and I must admit that I am totally impressed by Ubuntu. Its repositories are simply amazing. You can search and install almost everything that you require even linuxdcpp. Also I have seen that Ubuntu is highly documented when I was browsing through the LTSP section.

Last night accidently I found out that you can write on NTFS partitions from Linux, then I googled a little bit and found out that ntfs-3g the driver for NTFS partitions on Linux is actually read/write driver. Take a look at the [ntfs-3g home page](http://www.ntfs-3g.org/) and support section.

Cheers ðŸ™‚
