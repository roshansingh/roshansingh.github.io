I like to use Firefox because of the add-ons it provides. I mostly use Fast Dial, Webmail notifier, Download Them all, Twitterfox, Google toolbar. Just now I installed ScribeFire blog editor. This is really a cool add-on. You just have to press F8 and you get a nice interface, go ahead and type whatever you want to and just publish your post.   
I have written this post from ScribeFire and from now onwards I will use it to write posts.&nbsp;
