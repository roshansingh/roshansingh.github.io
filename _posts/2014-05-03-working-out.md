I started to work out last year around the same time. I can clearly remember my first day to the gym. I had almostÂ fainted after some running and some push ups. I was sweating profusely and trying to catch my breath while lying down on a mat. The 200 m walk to my home took more than 10 minutes and then I fell on my bed for another hour. That night after a lot of thinking I came to a conclusion that I had to get fit even if I had to go through what happened in the morning again.

IÂ have always been physically weak and underweight. I amÂ 6 feel tall and weighed ~68 kg last year. I was 8-10 kg short of normal body weight for my height.

Next day I was in the gym again. Prince, my instructor looked more worried than me. We chatted for sometime and then he said that I should just do very little work out for a first few months and eat as much as possible to gain at least 10 more kilos.

##### <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>First month:</strong></span>

I ate a lot. I just kept eating as much as possible. My diet chart was something like this:

**Pre workout:** 4Â bananas, 4 slices of bread with butter or cheese, occasionally oats

**Post Workout:Â **4 bananas, 4 egg whites,Â a bowl ofÂ sprouts, 1/2 litre of milk

**Lunch:Â **1 bowl of rice, dal and veggies.

**Evening:**Â Idly or anything rich in carbohydrates

**Night:** Chappati, veggies, 4 eggÂ whites, 1/2 milk before sleeping. 200-250 gm of chicken 2-3 times a week.

Then in the gym I just used to walk for 10 min and then 10 mins of cycling and some stretching exercises. Eating was the most difficult task for me. I could barely eat 1/2 biriyani before. After pre-workout diet I had to wait for at least 30 minutes for the food to settle down.

I also carried glucon-d in a bottle and used to sip(not drink) every couple of minutes.

##### <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Second month:</strong></span>

My diet was almost similar. Now I had started little bit of muscle training. For warm up I used toÂ cycle/walk for 10 minutes. I trained one muscle everyday with 3 different exercises &#8211; 3 repetitions each with increased weights. So I was training chest, biceps, triceps, shoulders, legs and back till Saturday and then took a day off on Sunday. I did throw up a couple of times. I was still weak and had felt dizzy at least a couple of times.

##### <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Third &#8211; Fifth month:</strong></span>

Prince suggested that if I should take some protein supplements if I could spend some money. He asked me to takeÂ massÂ gainer so that I can gain some more weight. I weighedÂ around 72 kg. By the fifth month, I weighed 76 kg and my workout schedule had changed to 2 muscle each day with 2 exercises each. I was able to do more weights and was at ease. I was a lot better at the end of fifth month.

##### <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sixth &#8211; Seventh month:</strong></span>

I had finished the 6 lb of mass gainer, so I took anotherÂ protein supplement. I was really in much better shape. I was doing more weights. My weight was 78 kg. I could work out for around an hour. I was back to doing one muscle with 4 exercise each and with more weights.

After seventh at the gym, I had to move to a new location. So that meant that I could not train with Prince anymore. He was pivotal in what I had achieved till then. So he suggested that we meet once every month and I should give him a treat ðŸ™‚

##### <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>&#8230; Now:</strong></span>

I just did 50 kg (25 + 25) barbell bench press a few days back (I love bench press). Â I am able to work out a lot more and do more weights for each muscle and am pushing my limits every month. I still meet Prince at least once every month and he changes my exercises every month.

And I weigh 82 kg and I have a small tummy which is visible now. Sometimes people say that I am getting fat, which I take as a compliment as I have never been called fat ðŸ˜› I need to start cutting downÂ now!

**Things that I learned:**

  * Diet is the most important thing. If I don&#8217;t eat properly, I can notice it the next day in the gym.
  * Breathing in and out during the movements of the exercise is crucial.
  * Maintaining good posture is also very important else you will get hurt. I have pulled my back muscles at least 3 time during the last one year.
  * Pre-workout diet is important and you should give sufficient time to digest it, otherwise you may vomit. For me it is 30 minutes.
  * Taking rest is equally important. I sleep for at least 7 hours.
  * Workout buddy &#8211; if you are starting, it will be really motivating. Prince was my trainer but if I skipped a day, he used to ask me where I was.
  * I have also learned my physical limits. I no longer feel dizzy, I know when to give up. Everyday is different.
