I came across this a few days back when my colleague showed me this. I was really fascinated with the patterns it was generating.

So after coming from office I sat down to write it finally. Read this([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway&#8217;s\_Game\_of_Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)) so that you can understand it properly. Then see the demo here:Â <http://roshansingh.in/code/gameoflife/>

Keep clicking the random button, you may get to see some wonderful patterns ðŸ™‚
