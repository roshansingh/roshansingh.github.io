Today is another big day for me, I have made a new release for GScribble along with RPMs for Fedora. I take this opportunity to thank my seniors [Debayan Bannerjee](http://debayan.wordpress.com) for all round support that he gave me during the college, [Shreyank Gupta](http://allsortsofshrink.blogspot.com) who did the artwork for GScribble and [Rangeen Basu](http://sherry151.blogspot.com) who helped me with packaging.

Being the first release the app is missing a lot of basic functionalities which I will provide later on. I will try to release as soon as I make some changes so that I keep myself involved in it.

I remember when I first started using Twitter I lost my patience to blog, then I realised that it was TwitterFox which was the main reason, I then tried to search for blog clients. Eventually I could not find any nice app. Since then I had decided that I would write an app for me.

I would also like to thank [Srijan technologies](http://www.srijan.in) who provided me sufficient free time during my internship that helped me a lot to work on it.
