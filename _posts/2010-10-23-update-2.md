Its been quite sometime that I have blogged. To begin with I have joined a job at Huawei Technologies in Aug this year. I really dont get much time for doing anything cool after a hectic 9-10 hours(9:30 ~ 7) a day schedule. And weekends pass by sleeping.

I have spent three months at Bangalore, and I must say that I am loving it! The weather is always pleasant. I have not seen scorching sun here till now :). And yes, I visited Wonder La also with my college friends, spent an awesome day there. For the first time I visited a water park, its a must place one must go if he/she is in Bangalore. 

The next big thing is FOSS.in. I missed PyCon because I did not have internet connection then. But I will certainly go for FOSS.in.
