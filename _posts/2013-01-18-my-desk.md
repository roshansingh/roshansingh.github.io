This is my desk.

<a href="http://roshansingh.in/blog/2013/01/18/my-desk/dsc_0475/" rel="attachment wp-att-488"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-488" alt="DSC_0475" src="http://roshansingh.in.cp-22.webhostbox.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC_0475-300x168.jpg" width="600" height="450" /></a>

So what do we have here:

  * Lenovo Thinkpad T530
  * Dell H2312HM Monitor
  * Microsoft Ergonomic 4000 Keyboard
  * 3M Ergonomic mouse
  * Apple Mini Displayport to DVi Adapter
  * Creative 2.1 Speaker system (not visible in the pic)

All the products are from different vendors. I had not noticed this until I took this pic.
