2014 was an incredible year for me. I travelled a lot. IÂ decided to end this year with another ride with some fellow bikers. This was a 4-day ride in which I covered Mudigere, Kudremukh, Sringeri, Agumbe, Chikmanglur and Mullayangiri.

We rode on the first day to Mudigere. A home stay was arranged for stay. It was a very secluded place and it took us a while to locate the place.

We went to a sun set point to spend the evening.

Next day I left for Sringeri for another solo ride. The roads were not very good. However Kudremukh forests were particularly very scenic to ride on.

Almost dried Bhadra river

Inside Kudremukh saw a sign board for a dam, so decided to check it out ðŸ™‚ It looked more like a desert than dam at this point since the river had dried.

Reached Agumbe sunset point around 3:45 pm. It was extremely crowded so I decided to head back to Sringeri and find a stay.

Sringeri &#8211; Chikmanglur

Condition of road was pretty bad at the start. I had started around 6:30 am. It was extremely foggy. At one point I felt like I should head back to the hotel. Once the sun was out fog went away and the roads improved.
