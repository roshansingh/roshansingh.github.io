It has been a painful experience downloading and installing EVOLUTION. Huh! due to my GPRS connection which is very slow it took me a long time to download it also i had to begin from starting for two times as my modem hung.

Later, I did not know that for installing these things we need to install the **devel packages** of the various dependencies. Then I was not able to get the required version of the dependencies. So I am giving here the best repository for openSUSE 10.3 which I found out from **Webpin**. [opensuse evolution unstable reository.](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/srinidhi:/evolution-unstable/openSUSE_10.3)

Also dont try to use tar ball use rpms from any possible source to meet the dependency.

More over I got kicked in #evolution on Gimpnet because I did not know what a **pastebin** was. So I must tell that in case you need to put a long text or paste then use pastebin and send the link on **IRC**
  
[pastebin](http://www.pastebin.com)
  
Moreover later i found out that mozilla-nspr and mozilla-nspr and mozilla-nss for evolution data server and then it was done.

Another helpful link is [NOSIP EVOLUTION GETTING STARTED.](http://gnomebangalore.org/wiki/index.php/EvolutionBeginners)

Best of luck when you do this !!
