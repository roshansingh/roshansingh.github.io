openSUSE 11 was released during vacations. So I was waiting anxiously to download and use it. The day I came to college put my luggage in the room, managed to get the LAN wire patch ( I did not know where mine was) and checked for the internet. To my amazement the connection was proper and I was getting a download speed of around 1Mbps, it may be very commoin to you but in my college where we rarely get a speed of 50 kbps. I was thrilled. I started to download the iso which was around 4.2 GB. I managed to download it in 2 hours. I had gone mad. I told about this to every one I met.

Then I knew that I did not have a DVD to burn it. So what if I had managed to download the iso I must install it. I searched for a balank DVD but nobody had it. And it was a hot afternoon, I knew that i college shops would not be open. So I opened the iso with File Roller (it is a archive utility on Linux, which lets you extract iso images also). Thanks to [Debayan](http://debayan.wordpesss.com), he had told me about this during Mukti &#8217;08 when he extracted the iso and then installed it using LAN on several computers simultaneosly.

So i extracted the iso in a FAT drive. I had always known that installtion could be done directly from the hard disk. But i had never done this. So I started Windows mounted the iso using Daemon Tool (a utility on windows which lets you mount images iso, mdf etc). The SUSE   installer poped up. I breezed through it and restarted my laptop. Then booted up the installer. Then it came to a halt saying no repositories found or something of that sort, which happens when you dont use the DVD or CD as a medium for installtion. Then I selected the hard disk as the installtion media. Located the partition. Then it asked for the folder. I had the extracted iso in the  folder &#8220;suse&#8221;. Then i typed &#8220;suse&#8221; but nothing happened giving error &#8220;No repositories found&#8221; (i remember this error parcticularly). Then I tried  &#8220;/suse&#8221; and it worked. I was so excited but there was nobody near me whom I could tell this.

There was one more surprise inside. openSUSE 11 is shipped with KDE 4, this was what I wanted. If you haven&#8217;t seen KDE 4, just take a look at it. You will jsut love it. KDE 4 has an improved Kget, the download manager which gives you a speed equivalent to IDM on windows. So why use windows. The only reason I switch to windows is Counter Strike. I hope that some day it will be available.
