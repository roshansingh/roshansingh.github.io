Coin denomination problem is a very common question asked in interviews. It involves Greedy Approach, Dynamic Programming and Recursion. You may find a lot of stuff on the internet if you just google out &#8220;Coin denomination problem&#8221;.

A link that was really helpful for me to analyse the problem is <http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/jaa/CSG713.04F/Information/Handouts/dyn_prog.pdf>.

Some other helpful text to recollect things can be found [here](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/iap/interview/materials.php).
