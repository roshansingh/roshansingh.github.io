We woke up next day to freezing cold at Pang. One of the guys went to take a dump. After he was done, he noticed that water in the cans were frozen. Ice bucket challenge accepted ðŸ™‚ I leave the rest to your imagination.

Reached Jispa around 7 pm. We found a really nice hotel. The rooms were good and priced at Rs 800, possibly because the tourist season was almost over. Food was costly, but the chicken curry was out of the world!
