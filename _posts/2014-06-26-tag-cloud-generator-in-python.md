Python lacks good tag cloud generators which is simple to use. I needed it in a feature that I was working on. So I wrote a small tag cloud generator based on PIL. The quality of image generated is not very good but it does the job. It is inspired from <a href="https://github.com/lucaong/jQCloud" target="_blank">jQCloud</a>. Most of the logic has been taken from it.
