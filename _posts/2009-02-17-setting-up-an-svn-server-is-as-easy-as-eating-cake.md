I tried to set up an svn server on my laptop today as I have organized a hack session today to bring in more people for hacking FOSS.
  
I have chosen opendchub for three reasons:
  
1. They have seen it working. And they actually use it.
  
2. The source code is as less as 10 c files.
  
3. The project is dead. I have already applied for the maintainership. You dont apply please ðŸ˜›

This is a helpful link  [href=&#8221;http://en.opensuse.org/Setting\_up\_a\_Subversion\_server\_using\_Apache2](http://en.opensuse.org/Setting_up_a_Subversion_server_using_Apache2) . I hope everything turns out positively.
