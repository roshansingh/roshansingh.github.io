There was a marathon from Khardungla to Leh so the the roads were closed for first half. I could barely walk there, wonder how people managed to run. Leh also has less oxygen as per my experience. It is nearly 55 km from Leh. Half of the road is good and rest is gravel.

Next day we went to Shanti Stupa. One hasÂ to climb nearly 200 steps to reach the stupa. After climbing only 20 steps I was panting.

I went for shopping in the evening and bought a shawl and a muffler for my parents.
