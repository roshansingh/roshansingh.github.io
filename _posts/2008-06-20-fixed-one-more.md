Finally I have moved past the difficult time ðŸ™‚ and have fixed another [bug](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=513438) . Added some general checks to validate the email id and phone number. This one was easy. It gave me some opportunity to work with &#8220;GLib&#8221; which can be used simply like the general int,chars etc and it has various added features. I have also understood how to use doc packages now.</a>

Devhelp is a packeges which help you to use these doc packages which contain the various documentations. They are really very helpful. One can get all sorts of information there. A must for developers !!
