Rangeen, who happens to be the only Fedora ambassador in our college did a very good work by creating a local Fedora repository <http://lug.nitdgp.ac.in/repository/fedora-local/> . I am an openSUSE user and I am satisfied with it, we also have a local packman mirror <http://lug.nitdgp.ac.in/repository/packman/> which happens to be the biggest repo for openSUSE. But the only problem is that it is not a complete repo, I mean while installing packages I need to download some packages from the internet also. But the Fedora repo which also has the updates is nearly a complete repo.

So I am thinking about trying Fedora now.
